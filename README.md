The main goal of this project is to analyze a dataset using different methods. The aim is to understand better how these methods work and how they help us when analyzing data. In particular, the methods we are going to present are: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and Cluster Analysis.

The project is built in R and uses a dataset extracted from http://www.statistics4u.com/fundstat_eng/data_bodyfat.html. The goal is to predict male body fat based on body measurements.
